      <th>Hello my name is Wendy Hernandez. Just like everyone else I have my own set of goals in life.
 My personal career goal is to become either a dental assistant or a dental hygienist. Both are very similar career choices but the major difference is dental assistants tend to directly assist the dentists, conducting small office tasks, and regularly have supervised jobs on patient’s teeth. While a dental hygienist mainly works one on one sessions with a patient and has very minimal supervised sessions. My plans for achieving my goals would include successfully graduating high school and applying to a college, university, or community college that offers Dental programs. I am drawn to this career choice because it still has to do with health care and helping people which I do enjoying doing . Multiple people take pride in their  smiles and some do not which is why I would want to help people build confidence about their smile. Also Dental hygiene is very beneficial towards your  teeth, gums , and can prevent gum disease which is why I would like to inform people on that. Plus the pay for the job is a good amount considering you do  not have  to attend school for such a long time period. Characteristics can be self labeled being because no knows you better than yourself. Some characteristics that I possess that I believe that relate to the profession of a dental assistant or a dental hygienist is me being a people’s person. I enjoy meeting new people and starting new conversations. For instance an experience I have with being a people  person is I work at a restaurant. In that restaurant I am constantly  taking customers orders and with that I have conversations with them asking how’s their day is going. Another characteristic I feel I can label myself is me being accurate. Accuracy is a very important skill to obtain as a dental assistant or a dental hygienist because you have to ensure you are completing the task that the patient requires. Again having experience working in a fast food restaurant I am required to ensure the customer's order is just the way they request it with no mistakes. Besides me sharing my characteristics,  within my high school years I was able to obtain accomplishments such as achieving honor roll , and participating in honor courses. Apart from my academic progress I also participated in school activities such as Soccer, Girls build L.A, and volunteer work. Since I  was able to be part of a soccer team I was able to learn  things about myself. One of them being that if you truly do not believe in yourself you can not succeed. Self motivation is something that is a value of mines when completing everyday activities. During soccer when I would miss a shot or a pass at practice or especially in game I would sometimes lose grit. Which did not help me in any sort of way, I began motivating myself and ensuring myself that I do and will make mistakes which is okay to do so. Everyday forward I applied self motivation. 

Overall if you have a goal you feel as if you want to achieve,  do not let anyone stop you with negativity. Just have grit and carry on. Thank you for your time. Feel free to view my other pages on this site.
