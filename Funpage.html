     <p>I LIKE TO PLAY GUITAR !!! It's a  pretty cool game to play, having difficulties from easy, medium, hard, expert. I started from easy and now I play hard but sometimes expert depending on the type of song. Even though some guitar hero games I play are old and the graphics are not the best the game is still enjoyable.    </p>
